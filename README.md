# All used plots and code in included in this repository

# find_best_parameters kids_faint.py contains MAPE values stored in arrays which are used to produce the parameter plot

# final code.py is the main file that creates the samples from the MICE2 simulation data and produces/trains the model from set parameters using the _keras_ and _tensorflow_ packages

# gaussian.py and gaussian faint.py contain the calculated accuracies of each model for 10 different starting seed values and produces the PDF plots.

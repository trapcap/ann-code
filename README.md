# All used plots and code are included in this repository.

# find_best_parameters kids_faint.py contains MAPE values stored in arrays which are 
used to produce the parameter plot.

# final code.py is the main file that creates the samples from the MICE2 simulation 
data and produces/trains the model from set parameters using the _keras_ and 
_tensorflow_ packages.

# the gaussian.py and gaussian faint.py files contain the calculated accuracies of 
each model for 10 different starting seed values and produces the PDF plots.

# seeds used in bright sample:
    # seeds = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# as the faint sample only ran once for each model, the seed value was set to 1# All used plots and code in included in this repository
